/// Inbound communication between transceivers and managers.
///
/// The transceiver validates the message, and constructs
/// a `ValidatedTransceiverMessage` value.
///
/// The `new` function requires authenticates the transceiver, and stores its
/// identity in a phantom type parameter.
/// Thus, when the manager receives a value of type
/// `ValidatedTransceiverMessage<SomeTransceiverAuth, A>`, it knows it was
/// created by the transceiver that defines the `SomeTransceiverAuth` type.
///
/// The manager will then consume this message using the `destruct_recipient_only`.
/// As the function's name suggests, only the intended manager can consume the message.
/// This guarantees that once the transceiver has validated the message, it will be seen by
/// the appropriate manager.
/// This is not a strict security requirement, as long as the transceiver
/// doesn't implement its internal replay protection, because then no denial of
/// service is possible by a malicious client "hijacking" a validation.
/// Nevertheless, we restrict the consumption in this way to provide a static
/// guarantee that the message will be sent to the right place.
