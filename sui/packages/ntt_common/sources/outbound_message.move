/// Outbound communication between managers and transceivers.
///
/// The manager issues values of type `OutboundMessage<SomeTransceiverAuth>`
/// when it wants a particular transceiver (in this case the one that defines
/// the type `SomeTransceiverAuth`) to send a message.
///
/// The transceiver can unwrap the message using `unwrap_outbound_message`, and
/// indeed it has to, because `OutboundMessage`s cannot be dropped otherwise.
/// The manager implements replay protection, so it will only issue the message once.
/// (TODO: should we relax this? no harm in sending the same message multiple
/// times, the receiving side implements replay protection anyway)
/// Thus, it's crucial that the intended transceiver consumes the message.
///
/// Additionally, the `source_ntt_manager` field encodes the address of the
/// manager that sent the message, which is verified by checking the
/// `ManagerAuth` type in `new`. This way, the transceiver doesn't have to trust
/// the particular manager implementation to ensure it's not lying about its own
/// identity.
/// This is not super relevant in the current setup where transceivers are
/// deployed alongside the managers, but it is an important design decision for
/// the future, if we want to share a single transceiver between multiple managers.
